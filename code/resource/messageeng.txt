Hello sailor!
The basic command is "/ 7s N" where N is the number of dice you will roll! 
By adding "e" every 10 will retire another dice! 
By adding "b N" you will add the bonus N to each die rolled 
By adding "t  N" will change the threshold to N (default is 10) 
By adding "v  N" you will add the N villain dice to the pool
